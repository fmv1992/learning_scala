# Chapter 03: Functional Data Structures

* Functional data structures are by definition immutable.
    * Doesn't it imply then that FP suffers from a lot of data copying?
        * Data sharing is the strategy to avoid copying of data structures in FP.
* The book introduced the `_` for pattern matching (and pattern matching of course). I'm noting this because this enables us to use them on our exercises :) (there were used before in chapter 02 but not in an elegant manner).
