# Chapter 01: What is functional programming?

This chapter mainly displayed the basic characteristics of functional programming.

There is an important shift of **how** we build programs. One must avoid the side effects such as:

1.  Modifying a variable (reassignment included).

1.  Changing a data structure in place.

1.  Drawing on the screen.

The concept of referential transparency was presented, that is, an **expression** is RF if it can be replaced by its evaluation result without affecting the program.
