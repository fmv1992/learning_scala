# Chapter 02: Getting started with functional programming in Scala

This chapter presented core concepts of FP:

*   Functions are values: "And just like values of other types [...] functions can be assigned to variables, stored in data structures and ***passed as arguments to functions***".

*   Loops is to imperative programming what recursion is to functional programming.

*   Higher order functions: functions that take functions as arguments and return functions.

*   Polymorphic functions: a way to get around the static types (i.e.: how to write functions that take generic types arguments).

*   Exercises on currying and partial application.
