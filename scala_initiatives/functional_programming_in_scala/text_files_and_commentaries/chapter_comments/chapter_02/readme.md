# Chapter 02: Getting started with functional programming in Scala

This chapter presented core concepts of FP:

*   Functions are values: "And just like values of other types [...] functions can be assigned to variables, stored in data structures and ***passed as arguments to functions***".

*   Loops is to imperative programming what recursion is to functional programming.

*   Exercises on currying and partial application.

*   **Terms and concepts**

    *   Recursion: ???.

        *   Tail recursion: ???.

    *   Currying: ???.

    *   Partially applied functions: ???.

    *   Higher order functions (HOF): functions that take functions as arguments and return functions.

    *   Polymorphism (in FP): allows data type generalization in strongly typed languages such as `Scala`.
    *   Polymorphic functions (POLYF): a way to get around the static types (i.e.: how to write functions that take generic types arguments).
