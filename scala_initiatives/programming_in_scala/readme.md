# Chapter 09

"In languages with first-class functions, you can effectively make new control
structures even though the syntax of the language is fixed. All you need to do
is create methods that take functions as arguments."

"This technique is called the loan pattern, because a control-abstraction
function, such as withPrintWriter , opens a resource and “loans” it to
a function."
