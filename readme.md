# My journey in learning Scala.

This is my journey in learning Scala.

I'll be using the recommended book from the Scala [website](): []().

Each chapter will have its own "take-aways" in the according "readme.md" files. 

## Notes on the book

* As the author says the book is not an introduction to programming. Some programming skills are necessary (even though he gives a footnote on what a "recursion" is) :).
* The book has very short chapters much in line with today's learning materials. Even the first actual introductory chapter into Scala (chapter 02) is broken into two parts.
* The writing style is informal and the reading is a very pleasant activity.
