# Chapter 02: First Steps in Scala

* Do not declare the data types if not needed: "When the Scala interpreter (or compiler) can infer types, it is often best to let it do so rather than fill the code with unnecessary, explicit type annotations".
    * "Nevertheless it is often a good idea to indicate function result types explicitly, even when the compiler doesnâ€™t require it."
* Scala arrays are zero-index accessed with parenthesis: `(`.
* **Scala idents with two spaces.**
